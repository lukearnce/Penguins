## Relationship between multiple traits
Here are graphs exploring the relationship between multiple traits.
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) 
  
```

```{r}
penguins%>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm, color=species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

```
